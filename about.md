This mod contains 3 TYPES OF MODERATORS and you can change it in settings:

- **Moderator** ![moderator](frame:modBadge_01_001.png&scale:0.6)

- **Elder Moderator** ![eldermoderator](frame:modBadge_02_001.png&scale:0.6)

- **Leaderboard Moderator** ![lbmoderator](frame:modBadge_03_001.png&scale:0.6

Leaderboard moderator doesn´t do anything, cuz since all the management of the leaderboards is done externally to the game
